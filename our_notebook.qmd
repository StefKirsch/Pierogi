Notebooks are great, as they allow us playing around with both code and documentation, and allow other neat things like writing formulas and referencing works [@quarto2025].

We can refer to external functions in our notebook as well by sourcing files.

```{r import dependencies}
source("R/arithmetic_helpers.R")
source("R/stats_helpers.R")
```

These files contain some functions that we can already use:

## Group 1: Arthmetic

```{r perform arithmetic}
perform_arithmetic(10, 5, "add")
perform_arithmetic(10, 5, "subtract")
```

## Group 2: Statistics

```{r statistics function}
sample_numbers <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, NA)

calculate_stats(sample_numbers)
```
