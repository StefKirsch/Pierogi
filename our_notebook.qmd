Notebooks are great, as they allow us playing around with both code and documentation, and allow other neat things like writing formulas and referencing works [@quarto2025].

We can refer to external functions in our notebook as well.

```{r}

source("R/arithmetic_helpers.R")

perform_arithmetic(10, 5, "add")
perform_arithmetic(10, 5, "subtract")
```
